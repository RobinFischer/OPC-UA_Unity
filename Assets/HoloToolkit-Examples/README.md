# HoloToolkit-Examples
This folder will host samples/examples that exemplify the HoloToolkit to help solve interesting scenarios.
The reason these are examples is because they are specific scenarios which may be difficult to make a into a generic prefab.
These examples can eventually be incorporated into the core HoloToolkit.

#### When considering an example:

1. Examples are not like unit tests which exist in the Tests folder of each feature area.
2. Examples are ideas which use the HoloToolkit to show developers how they can solve problems on HoloLens using Unity.
3. Examples that are more of an end-end app, do not fit into the HoloToolkit-Examples folder.
4. Examples that are not maintained regularly will be deprecated.

#### When adding an example:

1. Create a new folder under HoloToolkit-Examples and give it a name that best describes your project.
2. You can add your example scenes under that folder.
3. Ensure you add a README.md so developers can read about the purpose and steps to run your example code.
4. Do not change the Project Settings for HoloToolkit-Unity with updates specific to your example.
